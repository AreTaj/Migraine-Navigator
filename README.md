# Migraine Navigator

Migraine Navigator is a comprehensive tool designed to help users both **track** and **predict** migraine occurrences. By combining detailed logging of migraine episodes with advanced machine learning models, this project empowers users to better understand their migraine patterns and anticipate future episodes.

## Features

- **Migraine Tracking:** Log migraine events, symptoms, triggers, medications, and weather data.
- **Migraine Prediction:** Predict the likelihood of future migraine episodes using state-of-the-art machine learning and ensemble models.
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize trends and patterns in your migraine history.
- **Customizable Analysis:** Integrate your own data and adjust model parameters for personalized insights.

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Main dependencies:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn
- xgboost
- tensorflow
- meteostat
- geocoder
- pytz

Some models and notebooks require:
- imbalanced-learn (for SMOTE and ensemble methods)
- xgboost (for XGBoost models)

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**: Execute the `main.py` file to start the application.

```sh
python main.py
```

2. **Input Data**: Use the "Input" tab to enter migraine instance details. Click the "Save Entry" button to save the data.

3. **View Entries**: Switch to the "View Entries" tab to see the logged entries in a table.

4. **Analyze Data**: Go to the "Analysis" tab to perform graphical analysis on the migraine data. Select the type of graph you want to display and click the "Analyze" button.

5. **Predict Migraines**: Use the "Prediction" tab to predict the likelihood of a migraine based on the input data and current weather conditions. Click the "Predict" button to see the prediction result.
