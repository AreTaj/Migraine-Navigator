# Migraine Navigator: Patient Guide

**Data-driven tracking and analysis.**

---

## What is Migraine Navigator?
Migraine Navigator is a desktop application designed to help you **track**, **analyze**, and **predict** your migraine attacks. It correlates your symptom logs with local weather data and **lifestyle habits** to identify potential patterns.

## Key Features

### 1. The Risk Dashboard
*   **Live "Tomorrow Risk"**: See a gauge (e.g., "70% Risk") for tomorrow based on the weather forecast and your recent sleep/activity.
*   **24-Hour Plan**: A detailed hourly chart shows exactly *when* the risk is highest (e.g., "Peak risk at 2:00 PM due to pressure drop").

### 2. Smart Logging
*   **One-Tap Entry**: Log medications and triggers in seconds.
*   **Pain Slider**: An intuitive visual slider makes logging simple, even during an attack.
*   **Privacy First**: Your location is automatically detected for weather accuracy, but **never** tracked or saved.

### 3. Personalized Model
The app learns *your* specific triggers over time.
*   **Day 1-30 ("Cold Start")**: It uses basic **Baseline Sensitivity** settings (which you configure during onboarding) to provide initial estimates.
*   **Day 30+**: It switches to a custom Artificial Intelligence model built *just for you*, detecting unique patterns (e.g., "You only get migraines on Tuesdays when it rains").

## Getting Started

### Installation
1.  Download the latest release for macOS.
2.  Open the app and follow the "Onboarding" guide to set your baseline sensitivity (Are you very sensitive to weather? sleep?).

### Your First Week
*   **Log Daily**: Try to log once a day, even if you feel fine (logging "No Pain" is just as important!).
*   **Check the Graph**: Look at the dashboard in the morning to see if you need to take extra care today (e.g., drink more water, sleep earlier).
