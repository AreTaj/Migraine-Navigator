# Future Roadmap

The development plan is organized into feature clusters:

**Cluster 3: Advanced Analysis & Explanation**
- **[Issue #36] Risk Decomposition**: SHAP-style explanation for *daily* predictions (e.g., "Why is tomorrow High Risk? -> Because Pressure dropped 10hPa").
- **[Issue #28] Global Feature Importance**: Overall correlation analysis to identify a user's primary long-term triggers.
- **[Issue #27] Medication Efficacy**: Statistical analysis of pain reduction following specific acute medication doses.
- **[Issue #30] Migraine Simulator**: "What-If" analysis tool allowing users to adjust sliders (e.g. Sleep, Activity) to see how it impacts their immediate risk.
